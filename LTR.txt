*************************************************************************************************************************************

First, thanks to everyone for taking out your precious time to come up here to bid me farewell.

I have spent quite a lot of time, 5 years that is. So its always remembered as Cognizant being the first company. First 3 years were really essential for me when I was in Chennai. Unfortunately none of them were not in front of me this time. But my sincere respect goes to them who has really helped me gain indispensible knowledge, especially to my first manager Anand, who really helped me for the upliftment of my skills.

I am thankful to the company for giving me multiple opportunities and work exposure to hone my skills and gain expertise in my domain.
Overall, its a good platform for freshers like us. Here, I have learned to do multi-tasking, such as team management, strategy building, real-time plan execution, etc. Earlier, I was short-tempered and fickle-minded, but after taking on the role of a senior, there was no other way for me, but to expand my horizon and embrace other people’s opinion, to value them and listen to them with patience. This has helped me to accomplish my work goals without hurting anyone’s sentiments, I believe!

Being part of a team has taught me skills that I can use in more than just the professional area of my life. Thanks to some of the things I've learned from many of you. Needless to say, I am bidding goodbye to this company after having gained a wealth of knowledge, which I will treasure forever.

I want to emphasize the point that sometimes we should not think about ourselves, but people associated with us. This is the key to maintain relations – be it personal or professional. So when you will be given the team to handle, I know you all will prove to be the good managers. My wish for you all present here is the unending success, prosperity and wealth. May you get what you deserve and earn fulfilling results in all your future projects!

This goodbye is not forever, it just marks a brief pause in our daily meetings and our togetherness. We are going to stay connected always.
Lets not consider this as an event of partition or separation from you guys rather celebrate this as finding another vista. I know many of us are trying hard to catch up a career on Big Data domain and I wish them luck for their perseverance, hard working and sincerity. 

Thank you once again for everything and organizing such an amazing farewell party for me to take back home some fond memories of my last day. I am looking forward to hear more success stories of the company and you all. Hope, our path will meet once again in near future. Till then good by and thank you for everything.
